    Introductory.</h2>
  <p class="v2 dropcap">
    It has been our good fortune to find the fountain of youth lurking
    in the out-door pleasures of Skating, Swimming, Rowing, Horseback
    Riding, Tennis, Base Ball and Cricket. The “grown-up” folk are now
    engaged in utilizing the discovery made by youth thousands of
    years ago, that health and happiness depend upon their innocent
    amusements. College Faculties have realized that the morals of
    youth as well as success in after life, depend upon the good
    health engendered by competitive pastimes. The strength of a
    nation lies in the correct training of the young.<a id="intro_1a">
    </a>“England’s great victories on land and sea were won by the
    men, who when boys wielded a cricket bat, pulled an oar, or kicked
    the foot ball.” America too has had her conflicts, and may have
    others.</p>
  <p id="intro_2">
    These lines are offered to the youth of this fair land, in the
    hope that their innocent play may prepare them mentally,
    physically and morally for whatever battles life may have in store
    for them. We believe there are many who would gladly learn to play
    cricket, if the opportunity presented itself. Only the favored few
    live near established grounds, while the many are unable to find
    even a book upon the game. The enjoyment of cricket, followed by
    the good health which it brings, is within the easy grasp of all,
    nor does it depend upon the standard of the play, but turns rather
    upon its equality.</p>
  <p id="intro_3">
    The memories of the past, though dear to many, will not be used to
    bore those who look rather to the future. But a few words about
    the origin of the game we love, may prove interesting. Early in
    the century Englishmen were found playing their national game upon
    the beautiful meadows of Germantown. Young America, as quick then
    as now, to imitate a good thing, organized a Germantown Cricket
    Club, and played upon a field of the Belfield farm from 1840 to
    1846. Those were the glorious days of underhand bowling, forward
    hits and single wicket. A stone roller borrowed from a neighboring
    garden smoothed the pasture, and almost the only recollection we
    retain of this primitive crease, is of two spots bare of grass,
    indicative of constant use. This club was the pioneer of cricket
    by Americans, and the forerunner of the present Germantown Cricket
    Club, which used the impliments left by the old club, to play its
    first games, and became the direct heir of both its name and
    property. But the Philadelphia Club, which organized a year before
    the Germantown, grew out of an organization known as the Union
    Cricket Club, which upheld the honor of Philadelphia Englishmen
    against New York Englishmen during the “Forties.”</p>
  <p id="intro_4">
    During this decade some University men organized a cricket club
    known as the Juniors, and played upon the Union ground. Matches
    were played and prize bats were offered by Dr.&nbsp;Mitchell, the
    father of Dr.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Weir Mitchell, one of which is now in
    the possession of Wm.&nbsp;Rotch Wister, generally spoken of as
    the father of American Cricket, who won it by the handsome score
    of&nbsp;44, in the year 1845. All of these clubs disbanded and
    cricket slumbered till 1853, when the Philadelphia Club organized.
    Camden had been the scene of the Union and Junior Club’s matches,
    and it was again selected as the best site for the new ground.</p>
  <p id="intro_5">
    The names of Englishmen were numerous upon the rolls of this club,
    and their professional Tom Seinor was the typical fast round arm
    bowler of the period. He trained the elevens to meet the
    St.&nbsp;George and New York Clubs, and was regarded with awe and
    wonder by the young American cricketer. The
    boy or even the man, who could block the cannon balls of the
    mighty Yorkshireman was the hero of the hour. The idea of hitting
    his terrefic balls scarcely entered the heads of the boys. Only
    Englishmen were supposed to be able to score against such speedy
    bowling.</p>
  <p id="intro_6">
    The Germantown boys who had organized their club in 1854, played
    only one or two local teams during its first season, chief of
    which was against the Delphian Circumferaneous, whose enthusiasm
    for cricket was often evinced before breakfast. A year later when
    practice had improved their play, they challenged the
    Philadelphian’s, who they had heretofore considered too powerful,
    but they paid the highest compliment to Tom Seinor, by barring
    him; for even in those early days they had a keen eye to the
    advantages of victory. But they were not afraid, old Bradshaw
    with his high buttoned vest and stiff high hat, nor of dear old
    Mrs.&nbsp;Bradshaw, with her kind words and her “coop of tay.”</p>
  <p id="intro_7">
    From a cricketing standpoint, the English of that day regarded the
    American almost with contempt; sixteen, eighteen and often
    twenty-two, if the latter number could be mustered, were matched
    against eleven Englishmen. Records of many such matches may be
    found during the Forties and Fifties. The last we believe was
    played when George Parr’s eleven played a twenty-two, composed of
    the best English and American cricketers from New York, Newark,
    and Philadelphia, in the Fall of 1859. Lockyer the great wicket
    keeper, Jackson, the fast bowler, Hayward and Carpenter the
    magnificent batsmen, with Julius Ceasar, Lillywhite Caffyn, and
    the rest won a well fought victory. Before Carpenter had made half
    a dozen runs, he elevated a mis-called “wide” into the hands of
    “mid off” who caught it, the umpire declined to rectify his
    palpable error, so the batter was “not out” on a “catch.”Hayward
    was in with Carpenter when this culpable descision was made, and
    before a separation occurred, more
    than one hundred runs had been scored. Many who saw this match
    declared that but for the error, the Professionals might have not
    won the game.</p>
  <p id="intro_8">
    All England elevens composed entirely of professionals, still play
    twenty-twos in the country districts of England, and often win,
    even against such enormous odds. American patriotism no longer
    permits such differences in opposing teams, but prefers to
    equalize the merits of players, in order to secure well contested
    matches.</p>

    CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
    <span class="xs">
      COMPARING BASE BALL WITH CRICKET.</span></h2>
  <p class="v2 dropcap">
    The popular demand for perfect ball playing, has developed such
    marked differences in England and America, that a short comparison
    between base ball and cricket may be of interest to some readers,
    and may tend to greater toleration. Here the professional has been
    brought into undue prominence, because of his recognized skill,
    while the people ignore the efforts of the amateurs, and cannot be
    induced to part with their “quarter” to see a “comedy of base ball
    errors,” or witness the efforts of the undisciplined cricketer, to
    amuse himself at their expense.</p>
  <p id="c1_2">
    In England the superiority of the professional cricketer is quite
    as marked as that of the professional base ball player, but his
    skill is employed in his regular business, which consists in
    teaching the amateurs, who abound in countless numbers. They are
    called “gentlemen” cricketers, as distinguished from their
    preceptors, the professionals, and play their National game as
    well, or perhaps better. The exhibition of base ball professionals
    in every city of America, has given the youth of this generation,
    opportunities to learn the game and their magnificent ball playing
    upon the diamond, is a worthy example for American cricketers, and
    the popularity of the “National Game” is largely due to the skill
    of these professional experts. The organizations are sustained by
    capitalists, whose investments depend upon the character of the
    games, and the system has given it an impetus which has placed it
    in the front rank of American sport, and brought the play up to
    the highest standard. Cricket on the contrary is played in America
    almost exclusively by amateurs, who deserve the highest praise for
    the manner in which they have upheld American Cricket, especially
    when it is remembered that their English adversaries, inherit
    their “national” game from their fathers, grand-fathers, and
    great-grand-fathers, and that each generation of cricketers takes
    up and improves upon the play of its predecessor.<a id="c1_2a">
    </a>Many clubs employ “professionals” as teachers, who not
    withstanding their superior cricket are always excluded from “trophy”
    matches.</p>
  <p id="c1_3">
    This comparison we believe will interest enquirers after facts,
    while those whose vision is obscured by a total eclipse of either
    game, will “skip” to something more interesting. The “base” in the
    National game corresponds with the “run” in cricket, and is ninety
    feet long; the distance between wickets is sixty-six feet, but
    between creases which is the length of a run, the distance is
    fifty-eight feet, or thirty-two feet shorter than a base. The
    average runner of a “base” must consume enough additional time to
    cover the added distance. Supposing that two and one-half seconds
    is required by the runner of the base, only one and one-half
    seconds is consumed by the cricketer in making his run. This
    difference in “time” means a preponderating advantage to the
    fielder upon the diamond, and a corresponding one to the batsman
    in cricket. The public, chiefly for this reason, has pronounced
    upon the sloth of cricketers, and the rapidity of those who play
    base ball. The unthinking spectator concludes
    that cricketers are sleepy, while fielders upon the diamond are
    consiantly performing feats of wonder. The cricketer makes his run
    of only fifty-eight feet with ease and almost certainty if he uses
    fair discretion, while the striker of a base ball must attempt his
    “run” though bitter experience tells him that it is an
    impossibility. It will at once be seen that the runner of the
    compulsary long “base” is almost handicapped out of the race by
    the cricketer who makes a discretionary short “run.”</p>
  <p id="c1_4">
    The baseball fielder has been given tremendious “time,” advantages
    over the cricket fielder by the long base as well as by the
    “forced” run. These advantages are increased by the construction
    of the diamond, which “fouls off” three-quarters of the field,
    thereby permitting eight fielders to be placed almost elbow to
    elbow in front of the doomed batter. “Side out” has become such a
    forgone conclusion that changes in the rules must follow, if
    interest in the game is expected from the public.</p>
  <p id="c1_5">
    Many features of the game of single wicket cricket correspond with
    base ball. The efforts of the batter are, limited to hits forward
    of the wicket, while the run is one hundred and twenty-four feet,
    but this style of cricket has become obsolete, owing to the same
    objections which exist in base ball, and has given place to double
    wicket cricket. There the impartial observer will find no undue
    advantage given either to batter, fielder or bowler.
    But if a game is played between cricketers of like standard,
    every department is in strict equiblirum, while opportunities are
    offered to skillful performers unknown in base ball. Some
    misguided lovers of American cricket have tried to popularize the
    game through base ball modifications, but their failure was a
    forgone conclusion, owing to essential differences in the theories
    of the two games. If they will reflect a moment, we think they
    will see that base ball has reached a stage only somewhat beyond
    single wicket cricket, which gave place to the double wicket game,
    about the year 1800, but it is so many years behind modern
    cricket, that the year 1900 is likely to arrive before such
    changes are made, as will place the different departments of the
    game in balance. Yet the anomoly of the inferior game producing
    the best exponents exists in America, and is the production of
    that antagonism between amateurism and professionalism, which
    seems to be never ending. The difference though
    social and educational is enormously enchanced by business reasons,
    which have done base ball little if any good. Cricketers have kept
    their game above reproach, and though often taunted because they
    have imported an English game, it will be admitted even by the
    admirers of America’s “national game” that English cricket has
    overcome the corruption of the “gambler” and “blackleg,” of past
    generations and become the keystone of English sport, and this
    result has been brought about by skilful play unaided by tricks
    upon players or partiality of umpires.</p>
  <p id="c1_6">
    It is our intention to give some hints to those, who seek pleasure
    and health from cricket pure and simple, for we are most firm in
    the belief that good fielding, good bowling, and above all good
    wicket keeping, now almost a lost art in America will popularize
    cricket.</p>

      DARK DAYS OF CRICKET.</span></h2>

    If American parents will take the time to read what the Reverend
    James Pycroft says in Chapter&nbsp;VI of his Cricket Field, which
    we have taken the liberty of quoting in full, it may give them
    food for thought. It was the good fortune of the writer to read
    this delightful book early in life, and he has quoted from it

      A DARK CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF CRICKET.</p>
    <p class="v1">
      The lovers of cricket may congratulate themselves at the present
      day that matches are made at cricket, as at chess, rather for
      love and the honor of victory than for money.</p>
    <p id="c2_3">
      It is now many years since Lord’s was frequented by men with
      book and pencil, betting as openly and professionally as in the
      ring at Epsom, and ready to deal in the odds with any and every
      person of speculative propensities. Far less satisfactory was
      the state of things with which Lord F.&nbsp;Beauclerk and
      Mr.&nbsp;Ward had to contend, to say nothing of the earlier days
      of the Earl of Winchelsea and Sir Horace Mann. As to the latter
      period, ‘Old Nyren’ bewails its evil doings. He speaks of one
      who had ‘the trouble of proving himself a rogue,’ and also of
      ‘the legs at Marylebone,’ who tried, for once in vain, to
      corrupt some primitive specimens of Hambledon innocence. He
      says, also, the grand matches of his day were always made for
      500<i>l.</i> a side. Add to this the fact that the bets were in
      proportion, that Jim and Joe Bland, of turf notoriety, Dick
      Whitlom, of Covent Garden, Simpson, a gaming house keeper, and
      Toll, of Isher, as regularly attended at a match as Crockford
      and Gully at Epson and Ascot; and the idea that all the Surrey
      and Hampshire rustics should either want or resist strong
      temptations to sell is not to be entertained for a moment. The
      constant habit of betting will take the honesty out of any man.
      A half-crown sweepstakes, or betting such odds as lady’s long
      kids to gentleman’s short ditto, is all very fair sport; but if
      a man after years of high betting can still preserve the fine
      edge and tone of honest feeling, he is indeed a wonder. To bet
      on a certainty must be very bad moral practice.</p>
    <p id="c2_4">
      ‘If gentlemen wanted to bet,’ said Beldham, ‘just under the
      pavileon sat men ready with money down to give and take the
      current odds, and by far the best men to bet with, because if
      they lost it was all in the way of business: they paid their
      money and did not grumble.’ Still they had all sorts of tricks
      to make their betting safe. ‘One artifice,’ said Mr. Ward, ‘was
      to keep a player out of the way by a false report that his wife
      was dead.’ Then these men would come down to the Green Man and
      Still, and drink with us, and always said that those who backed
      us, or ‘the nobs,’ as they called them, sold the matches: and
      so, sir, as you are going the round beating up the quarters of
      the old players, you will find some to persuade you this is
      true. But don’t believe it. That any gentleman, in my day, ever
      put himself into the power of these blacklegs by selling
      matches, I can’t credit. Still, one day I thought I would try
      how far these tales were true. So, going down into Kent with
      ‘one of high degree,’ he said to me, ‘Will if this match is won,
      I lose a hundred pounds.’ ‘Well,’ said I, ‘my Lord, you and I
      could order that.’ He smiled as if nothing were meant, and
      talked of something else; and, as luck would have it, he and I
      were in together, and brought up the score between us, though
      every run seemed to me like ‘a guinea out of his Lordship’s
      pocket.’</p>
    <p id="c2_5">
      In those days foot races were very common. Lord Frederick and
      Mr.&nbsp;Budd were first-rate runners, and bets were freely
      laid. So, one day, old Fennex laid a trap for the gentlemen: he
      brought up to act the part of some silly conceited youngster,
      with his pockets full of money, a first-rate runner out of
      Hartfordshire. This soft young gentleman ran a match or two with
      some known third-rate men, and seemed to win by a neck, and no
      space to spare. Then he calls out, ‘I’ll run any man on the
      ground for 25<i>l.</i>, money down.’ A match was quickly made,
      and money laid on pretty thick on Fennex’s account. Some said,
      ‘Too bad to win of such a green young fellow;’ others said,
      ‘He’s old enough—serve him right.’ So the laugh was finely
      against those who were taken in; ‘the green one’ ran away like
      a hare!</p>

      It is the unexpected which occurs in life as well as in cricket,
      therefore do not anticipate the movements of your antagonist but
      let your actions be governed by developments.</p>
    <p class="v8" id="c2_6">
      ‘You see, sir,’ said one fine old man, with brilliant eye and
      quickness of movement, that showed his right hand had not yet
      forgot its cunning, ‘matches were bought, and matches were sold,
      and gentlemen who meant honestly lost large sums of money, till
      the rogues beat themselves at last. They overdid it; they spoilt
      their own trade; and, as I told one of them, a knave and a fool
      makes a bad partnership: so you and yourself will never
      prosper. Well, surely there was robery
      enough; and not a few of the great players earned money to their
      own disgrace; but, if you’ll believe me, there was not half the
      selling there was said to be. Yes I can guess, sir, much as you
      have been talking to all the old players over this good stuff
      (pointing to the brandy and water I had provided), no doubt you
      have heard that B—— sold as bad as the rest. I’ll tell the
      truth; one match up the country I did sell,—a match made by
      Mr.&nbsp;Osbaldestone at Nottingham. I had been sold out of a
      match just before, and lost 10l., and happening to hear it I
      joined two others of our eleven to sell, and get back my money.
      I won 10l. exactly, and of this roguery no one ever suspected
      me; but many was the time I have been blamed for selling when as
      innocent as a babe. In those days when so much money was on the
      matches, every man who lost his money would blame some one.<a
      id="c2_6b"> </a>Then if A missed a catch, or B made no runs,—and
      where’s the player whose hand is always in?—the man was called a
      rogue directly. So when a man was doomed to lose his character,
      and bear all the smart, there was the more temptation to do like
      others, and after ‘the kicks’ to come in for ‘the half-pence.’
      But I am an old man now, and heartily sorry I have been ever
      since, because, but for that Nottingham match, I could have
      said, with a clear conscience, to a gentleman like you, that all
      that was said was false, and I never sold a match in my life;
      but now I can’t. But if I had fifty sons, I would never put one
      of them, for all the games in the world, in the way of the
      roguery that I have witnessed. The temptation really was very
      great,—too great by far for any poor man to be exposed to,—no
      richer than ten shillings a week, let alone harvest time. I
      never told you the way I first was brought to London. I was a
      lad of eighteen at this Hampshire village, and Lord Winchelsea
      had seen us play among ourselves, and watched the match with the
      Hambledon Club on Broad-halfpenny, when I scored forty-three
      against David Harris, and ever so many of the runs against
      David’s bowling, and no one ever could manage David before. So,
      next year, in the month of March, I was down in the meadows,
      when a gentleman came across the field with Farmer Hilton, and
      thought I, all in a minute, now this is something about cricket.
      Well, at last it was settled, I was to play Hampshire against
      England, at London, in White Conduit-Fields ground, in the month
      of June. For three months I did nothing but think about that
      match. Tom Walker was to travel up from this country, and I
      agreed to go with him, and found myself at last, with a merry
      company of cricketers, all old men, whose names I had ever heard
      as foremost in the game—met together, drinking, card-playing,
      betting, and singing at the Green Man (that was the great
      cricketer’s house), in Oxfork Street,—no man without his wine, I
      assure you, and such suppers as three guineas a game to lose,
      and five to win (that was then the pay for players) could never
      pay for long. To go to London by a wagon, earn
      five guineas three or four times told, and come back with half
      the money in your pocket to the ploug again, was all very well
      talking. You know what young folks are, sir, when they get
      together: mischief brews stronger in large quantities: so many
      spent all their earnings, and were soon glad to make more money
      some other way. Hundreds of pounds were bet upon the great
      matches, and other wagers laid on the scores of the finest
      players, and that too by men who had a book for every race, and
      every match in the sporting world: men who lived by gambling;
      and as to honesty, gambling and honesty don’t often go together.
      What was easier, then, than for such sharp gentlemen to mix with
      the players, take advantage of their difficulties, and say, your
      backers, my Lord this, and the Duke of that, sell matches and
      overrule all your good play, so why shouldn’t you have a share
      of the plunder? That was their constant argument. Serve them as
      they serve you. You have heard of Jim Bland, the turfsman, and
      his brother Joe—two nice boys. When Jemmy Dawson was hanged for
      poisoning the horse, the Blands never felt safe till the rope
      was round Dawson’s neck, and, to keep him quiet, persuaded him
      to the last hour that they dared not hang him: and a certain
      nobleman had a reprieve in his pocket. Well, one day in April,
      Joe Bland found me out in this parish, and tried his game on
      with me. ‘You may make a fortune,’ he said, ‘if you will listen
      to me: so much for the match with Surrey, and so much more for
      the Kent match—’ ‘Stop,’ said I: ‘Mr.&nbsp;Bland, you talk too
      fast; I am rather too old for this trick; you never buy the same
      man but once: if their lordships ever sold at all, you would
      peach upon them if ever after they dared to win. You’ll try me
      once, and then you’ll have me in a line like him of the mill
      last year.’ No, sir, a man was a slave when once he sold to
      these folk: fool and knave aye go together. Still they found
      fools enough for their purpose; but rogues can never trust each
      other. One day a sad quarrel arose between two of them; that
      opened the gentlemen’s eyes too wide to close again to these
      practices. Two very big rogues at Lord’s fell a quarrelling, and
      blows were given; a crowd drew round, and the gentlemen ordered
      them both into the pavilion. When the one began, ‘You had
      20<i>l.</i> to lose the Kent match, bowling leg long hops and
      missing catches.’ ‘And you were paid to lose at Swaffham—Why did
      that game with Surrey turn about—three runs to get, and you
      didn’t make them?’<a id="c2_6d"> </a>Angry words came out fast,
      and, when they are circumstantial and square with previous
      suspiciens, they are proofs as strong as holy writ. ‘In one
      single-wicket match,’ he continued, and those were always great
      matches for the sporting men, because usually you had first-rate
      men on each side, and their merits known; dishonesty was as
      plain as this: just as a player was coming in (John&nbsp;B. will
      confess this, if you talk of the match) he said to me, ‘You’ll
      let me score five or six, for appearances, won’t you, for I am
      not going to make many if I can?’ ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘you rogue, you
      shall if I can <i>not</i> help it.’ But when a game was all but
      won, and the odds heavy, and all one way, it was cruel to see
      how the fortune of the day then would change about. In that Kent
      match,—you can turn to it in your book (Bentley’s scores),
      played 28th July, 1807, on Pennenden Heath,—I and Lord Frederick
      had scored sixty-one, and thirty remained to win, and six of the
      best men in England went out for eleven runs. Well, sir, I lost
      some money by that match, and as seven of us were walking
      homewards to meet a coach, a gentleman who had backed the match
      drove by and said, ‘Jump up, my boys, we have all lost together.
      I need not mind if I hire a pair of horses extra, next town, for
      I have lost money enough to pay for twenty pair or more.’ Well,
      thought I, as I rode along, you have rogues enough in your
      carriage now, if the truth were told, I’ll answer for it; and
      one of them let out the secret some ten years after. But, sir, I
      can’t help laughing when I tell you, once there was a
      single-wicket match played at Lord’s, and a man on each side was
      paid to lose. One was bowler, and the other batsman, when the
      game came to a near point. I knew their politics, the rascals,
      and saw in a minute how things stood; and how I did laugh, to be
      sure; for seven balls together, one would not bowl straight, and
      the other would not hit; but at last a straight ball must come,
      and down went the wicket.’</p>
    <p id="c2_7">
      From other information received, I could tell this veteran that,
      even in his much-repented Nottingham match, his was not the only
      side that had men resolved to lose. The match was sold for
      Nottingham too, and that with less success, for Nottingham won:
      an event the less difficult to accomplish, as Lord Frederick
      Beauclerk broke a finger in an attempt to stop a designed and
      wilful overthrow! and played the second innings with one
      hand.</p>
    <p id="c2_8">
      It is true, Clarke, who played in the match, thought all was
      fair; still, he admits, he heard one Nottingham man accused on
      the field, by his own side, of foul play. This confirms the
      evidence of the Rev.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;W., no slight authority in
      Nottingham matches, who said he was cautioned before the match
      that all would not be fair.</p>
    <p id="c2_9">
      ‘This practice of selling matches,’ said Beldham, ‘produced
      strange things sometimes. Once, I remember, England was playing
      Surrey, and, in my judgment, Surrey had the best side; still I
      found the Legs were betting seven to four against Surrey! This
      time they were done; for they betted on the belief that some
      Surrey men had sold the match, but Surrey played to win.</p>
    <p id="c2_10">
      ‘Crockford used to be seen about Lord’s, and Mr. Gully also
      occasionally, but only for society of sporting men; they did not
      understand the game, and I never saw them bet. Mr. Gully was
      often talking to me about the game for one season; but I never
      could put any sense into him! He knew plenty about fighting, and
      afterwards of horse-racing; but a man cannot learn the odds of
      cricket unless he is something of a player.’”</p>

    CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
    <span class="xs">
      FIELDING.</span></h2>
  <p class="v2 dropcap">
    American Cricket owes a debt of gratitude to base ball. The
    undaunted pluck that stops and holds the fierce grounder; the
    strong arm which returns it to the baseman; the steady judgement
    that guides the out-fielder to the fly; all deserve the highest
    praise. Cricket welcomes the base ball fielder to the cricket
    ground, gives him the post of severest duty, depends upon his keen
    eyesight, splendid throwing, quick action and steady nerve. She
    soon calls him her own; for these qualities are just what she is
    always wanting. Let base ball players then not hesitate, for all
    their training is in the line of perfect fielding on the cricket
    ground.</p>
  <p id="c3_2">
    The most important fielder is thought by many cricketers to be the
    bowler, nor do we wish to disparage the judgement of anyone
    prejudiced in favor of that opinion. But our belief, reached after
    deliberate thought, is that the wicket keeper who performs his
    arduous duties successfully, does greater service for his side
    than even the best bowler. Like the catcher in base ball, his
    position is one of danger, leg guards and gloves must be added to
    his outfit to prevent accidents. Even with these, only a man with
    a cool head, a correct eye, and a safe pair of hands, should
    attempt wicket keeping. He is almost an “unknown” in American
    cricket, but if we do not err, Vint of the Irish team, gave some
    free lessons in the art which will prove most advantageous. In
    Lockyer’s era the backstop was a factor which modern cricket has
    abandoned. He was the support of the wicket keeper, whose hands he
    saved from many hard blows, unnecessarily dealt him by cannon ball
    bowlers. He it was who performed the drudgery of a match.</p>

    “Among the advantages of cricket are the means it affords for
    physical improvement, the opportunities for bringing rich and poor
    into friendly communication, the inculcation of gentlemanly
    feeling, and the principles of mutual charity, good will, and
    moral harmony.”—<i>Wisden.</i></p>
  <p class="v8" id="c3_3">
    The advent of the fast bowler has been the chief means of changing
    the wicket keeper into a back fielder, he has at the same time
    given the opportunity to the aggressive batsman. The chief object
    of the fast bowler has been to frighten the timid batsman, and
    drive him to the tent. If he has been the Simon Pure article, he
    has fulfilled his mission, and even the crack batter has failed to
    score heavily. But has he not oftener through bumpy ground and
    wrong pitch, for the faster the bowling, the less control the
    bowler has over the ball, given the other side the victory? Let
    not this be considered a plea for the back stop, for he belongs to
    an almost forgotten age, but it is rather to put a brake upon the
    “demon” bowler. It is asking too much of a wicket keeper to stop
    every wild attempt of the machine bowler, or be abused by his
    side. Speedy bowling, under wise control and supported by prompt
    and efficient fielding, has distinct advantages, but with slow
    fielding it is a menace to its own eleven, and has been the means
    of increasing the score of the adversary, who need not display
    even good batting to accomplish the result.</p>
  <p id="c3_4">
    The most serious question which confronts the American captain of
    to-day, is a “stumper.”<a id="c3_4a"> </a>But we believe so
    thoroughly in the progressive spirit of American cricket, that
    when attention is called to the importance of “stumping,” and to
    the fact that the aggressive batter glories in a wicket keeper
    whose position is twenty feet behind the wicket, and whose arms
    are of normal length, that the wicket keeper will soon become a
    real, rather than an imaginary personage upon the cricket field;
    and that he will again be seen close behind his wicket, forcing
    the batsman to display his prowess within his crease, or suffer
    the penalty. Let us predict that when this desirable result is
    accomplished, bowlers will be found to rely upon pitch and curve,
    rather than upon speed, and that skill will depend more upon brain
    than muscle. His position must always be such, that the wicket is
    between himself and the approaching ball, for he cannot run the
    risk of trying to “down” a wicket which he cannot see, neither can
    he spare the time to turn around, for the run is short and the
    runner may be a “sprinter.”</p>
  <p id="c3_5">
    The object of the bowler should be either to bowl the wicket; to
    have a batter give a chance for a catch; or, to force the batter
    to leave his ground for a stump. Unless he can vary his intention
    to thwart the batsman by the delivery of unexpected and difficult
    balls, he cannot expect to rank among the best, nor will he be
    called a head bowler. The only ball which the bowler can depend
    upon for uniform good results, strikes the turf outside the reach
    of the batter. Good batsmen safely block or hit any ball falling
    within six feet of the crease, some reach a ball which drops eight
    feet or more from the crease. But every batsman has a limit when
    the wicket keeper is in place. That spot, a little nearer the
    bowler than this limit is known as the “pitch” or “length.” The
    bowler must direct his efforts to gauge the batter’s reach, and
    deliver balls which will prevent scoring. When a bowler discerns
    the “length” ball a batsman cannot play, and his skill enables him
    to deliver it at will, he may be relied upon. It is the eager hope
    of every beginner to become a superior bowler. We have endeavored
    to indicate just what a good ball is and wherein it differs from
    one which the batter fancies. But this is not enough; the mind of
    the young bowler must solve the problem, and must have a well
    defined conception of the ball which is expected to baffle the
    batter. Having reached a satisfactory conclusion upon this all
    important subject, the physical effort to execute his theories
    must now be regularly practiced until he has mastered the art.</p>
  <p id="c3_6">
    1st.—Almost every good bowler holds the ball in the fingers at
    right angles to the seams, for two reasons, first a better grip
    can be taken; second, if any twist or spin is desired, the
    roughness of the seams increases the action of the fingers.</p>
  <p id="c3_7">
    2nd.—Begin delivering what are technally known as slow balls. Do
    not attempt fast bowling until your mechanical command of the ball
    has in a large degree, been able to materialize from your
    conception of what a good ball should be. This mechanical command
    of the ball comes from practice only. When it is
    observed that every batsman has his own peculiar style, some right
    handed, some left, some long, some short reach, some forward, some
    back, the beginner will at once percieve that success depends upon
    this, absolute command of the ball. When the possible fast bowler
    has learned to bowl “slows” with precision, he may put up an
    occasional fast ball. If he has properly conceived the art of
    slows, the chances are all in favor of his also becoming a good
    fast bowler. No eleven is perfect with only slow bowlers. Batters
    must be worried by fast as well as slow balls. But let every
    bowler whose ambition is to attain speed, recollect that accurate
    slows are the fore-runners of speedy balls.</p>
  <p id="c3_8">
    3d.—The slow bowler having mastered the pitch or length must
    practice twists or spins by which he endeavors to deceive the
    batsman. These must be performed with such ease that mind and body
    simultaneously act, the ball rotating upon its own axis, with such
    force that when it leaves the ground it no longer continues in its
    apparent direction, but rising abruptly according to the bowler’s
    desire passes the astonished batsman into the wicket.</p>
  <p id="c3_9">
    4th.—An easy elegant style of bowling is attained with less
    fatigue than a slouchy one. Some men will start ten yards behind
    the bowler’s crease, rush at it as though preparing for a
    somersault, come to a halt to deliver a disappointing ball. The
    fault here lies in the misconception of the bowler. He has not
    studied cause and effect, nor has he studied his own powers. These
    must not be squandered upon an over or two, but must be husbanded
    for a long day’s work.</p>
  <p id="c3_10">
    5th.—Place the ball as near the batsman as possible without its
    becoming a full ball, should such a ball strike slightly to leg,
    all the chances are in favor of its working between legs and bat
    into the wicket.</p>
  <p id="c3_11">
    6th.—The objects of attack are the wickets of the enemy. Straight
    balls only can take wickets. The bowler of such balls is likely to
    be in demand. He is sure to force a defensive opposition, of which
    a good captain can take advantage.</p>

      No. 5—THE HALF BACK BLOCK.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="blk10 v8">
      If you play for your side and not for yourself, at the end of
      the match your average will be better, than if you have
      constantly had upon your mind the disturbing element of
      selfishness.</p>
  <p class="v8" id="c3_12">
    7th.—Bowling for hits has become a usual method, when persistent
    blockers guard the stumps, a dozen runs is a small addition to the
    latter’s score in exchange for a wicket.</p>
  <p id="c3_13">
    8th.—“Study the furthest point to which your man can play forward
    safely, and pitch just outside that point with every variety of
    pace and spin.”</p>
  <p id="c3_14">
    9th.—All other points being equal the bowler who rotates the ball
    most rapidly upon its own axis will capture the greatest number of
    wickets.</p>
  <p id="c3_15">
    10th.—Learn to bowl from either side of the wicket, or to change
    the delivery or speed without the appearance of so doing.</p>
  <p id="c3_16">
    11th.—If a bowler is left-handed he should study bowling with
    extra care. He may, if he gives his mind to it, become great in
    that department. The reason being found in the simple fact that it
    is unusual and disconcerting to the batsman; nine men of every ten
    being right-handed.</p>
  <p id="c3_17">
    12th.—A high delivery has its advantages as well as its
    objections. It must not be overlooked that what is gained by
    elevation is lost by the difference of angle. The angle which the
    course of the ball describes is greater when the arm is at right
    angles with the body than when elevated. The delivery from an
    elevated hand is made with a view to catches more than to bowled
    wickets. A delivery which combines elevation and angle has been
    adopted by the best bowlers. The ball strikes the ground with
    greater force, causing a more sudden and unexpected rise, while
    the spin and angle add to its disturbing effect upon the mind of
    the batsman.</p>
  <p id="c3_18">
    13th.—The bowler more than any other fielder needs patience,
    perseverance and pluck. He must be strong, steady and sure. He
    must smile and look happy when catches are missed. He must look
    contented and satisfied when the umpire gives decisions against
    his interest. All will recognize the successful bowler even
    without the aid of these few rules.</p>
  <p id="c3_19">
    Point is next in importance, he is always expected to have safe
    hands, for when a fast ball is cut to point, a run is sure to
    result if he is not alert; in ancient cricket he stood much nearer
    the batsmen than at this period. His place is now so far from the
    striker that his position upon the field seems to have given way
    to silly point, a position so dangerous that a fielder possessing
    great courage generally volunteers for it. Few captains would
    order a man to the position of silly point, yet there are still
    fewer who do not delight in the man who fills it advantageously,
    for “chances” abound near the wicket.</p>
  <p id="c3_20">
    The slips, short leg and mid wickets follow in importance, while
    the outfielders and covers should not be deficient as stoppers,
    while as throwers they frequently have grand opportunities for the
    display of great activity. The Australian and English teams who
    came to this country were most effective fielders, and our native
    cricketers learned much from their prowess. They seemed
    ubiquitous. The ball did not seem ever to bore its way through
    them, their anticipation of its direction seemed instinctive. But
    if a hard hit one passed through the phalanx and did get by the
    fielder and was rapidly wending its way to the boundarys, the
    foreigner chased it with a speed and determination which gradually
    overtook it before it reached the ropes, thus reducing the score
    to a minimum. Let the cricket fielder constantly bear in mind that
    the time allotted to him to pick up and return the ball to the
    wicket is less than that required for a fast runner to traverse
    18&nbsp;yards at speed. If he is just as fast as the runner his
    exertions are lost to his side, for the batsman has reached his
    crease. The fielder must therefore be mentally and physically
    active while the ball is in play. It is not enough for him to take
    the ball and return it to the wicket keeper.<a id="c3_20a">
    </a>Thousands of wickets have been held by a failure on the part
    of the fielder to return to the right wicket. Which one that is
    can only be determined by instant thought followed by immediate
    action. If the fielder waits for notification to receive and
    return the ball he will in ninety-nine cases out of every hundred
    belong to the bump on the log variety.</p>
  <p id="c3_21">
    Fielding should be practiced whenever cricketers meet on the turf.
    Many captains advocate meeting for fielding only. In view of the
    numerous occasions for practice which constantly present
    themselves it seems to the writer unnecessary. But these must be
    used. The hardness of the cricket ball causes fear to the
    unpracticed. It hurts tender hands to be rudely struck by the hard
    ball. Companions can practice fielding indoors or almost anywhere,
    if a ball is provided. Cricketers will find a ball a delightful
    companion. Passing it around gives the practice which fielders
    must have to become expert. A dozen occasions innure the hands to
    the sensation of stopping a fast ball. It will no longer feel
    hard, but the fielder will take it at lightning speed.</p>
  <p id="c3_22">
    Perfect fielding is absolutely unknown on the American cricket
    fields. Errors are so numerous even among the best players, that
    bowlers lose courage and nerve. Each fielder should recollect that
    he is the support of the bowler. The strength of every bowler
    depends upon his field. A catch missed means a game lost which
    might have been won. Most fielders feel little of the great
    responsibility resting upon them, and even many good ones fail to
    appreciate it.</p>
  <p id="c3_23">
    When our American gentlemen were winning the match against Surrey
    on the “Oval,” the sympathy of the London crowd was with the
    Americans, who they thought fielded better than the English
    gentlemen. One of the crowd said to the writer our cricketers
    “worship the bat.” They play forever in the nets, and forget the
    importance of fine fielding, this did not seem a just criticism,
    for although he has seen every foreign eleven that has ever played
    in America, he has never seen any American fielding compare in
    excellence with that of the English and Australians. Almost every
    American fielder fails to realize that there are two wickets. He
    picks up well, returns well, runs well, and the mechanical part is
    often better than that of his English brother, but when head work
    is needed the English fielder returns to the right wicket, and the
    batter little expecting it is run out. The American batter is
    expecting the same loose methods to prevail among English
    fielders, but disappointment awaits him, for much to his
    astonishment the English fielder recollects the other wicket.
    Nothing has impressed itself upon the writer’s mind in commenting
    upon the play of foreign elevens, like the constant watchfulness
    of the fielder. If English cricketers worship the bat at home,
    they show no evidence of it upon American cricket grounds. They
    set an example to American cricketers which the sooner they
    follow, the sooner will they equal their alert foreign
    competitors.</p>
  <p id="c3_24">
    The last fielder to be spoken of but the most important, is the
    captain of the XI. Upon his judgement in placing his men depends
    the result. He is responsible for the work of the field. He is
    looked to as the one to place his men in good or bad localities.
    If bad judgment is used he is most severely criticised by the
    on-lookers. If he shows good judgement he gets little credit, as
    the fielder is supposed to be doing it all and receives the
    applause. But the captain must be watchful,
    helpful, courageous and sanguine. He must not loose nerve and
    energy because his side is hunting leather. He must work harder
    because he has an up hill game. In short, he must lead all the
    time, and if he expects his side to follow, he must set the
    example.</p>

  <p class="v2 dropcap">
    An expert batsman experiences unspeakable pleasure during his
    innings. Cricketers glory in him, his friends delight in him, and
    the sweetest smile of his best girl emphasizes his triumph.</p>
  <p id="c4_2">
    Nearly every young American learns base ball before cricket. When
    he first stands before a wicket, he is almost paralysed by the
    fear of losing it. Nothing corresponding to it appears upon the
    diamond. When his wicket has been successfully attacked a few
    times he is disheartened, and is likely to abandon cricket and
    return to his first love. This is a critical period in the history
    of the beginner. But a hint from a cricketer able and willing to
    explain that the straight ball can be successfully met by the
    straight bat may open the gate of cricket to him.</p>

      No. 6—THE LATE BLOCK.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="blk10 v8">
      Courage, energy and decision, mark the successful cricketer.</p>
  <p class="blk10 v4">
      A good excuse is more easily made than a good play.</p>
  <p class="v8" id="c4_3">
    “A straight bat” is the technical term for an upright bat, as
    distinguished from a “cross bat.” It should also be explained to
    all aspirants that the regulation wicket was not constructed for
    beginners but for expert batsmen. But let us not digress from the
    blunt “straight bat question,” which staggers the “man out,” as
    did the straight ball his wicket. Why can a batsman who wields a
    “straight bat” make a long stand, and why does the bowler delight
    in the man who plays a “cross bat?” The answer is simple. A “cross
    bat” must of necessity be an imperfect defense for a perpendicular
    wicket.<a id="c4_3a"> </a>The minds of many boys seem to be
    constructed upon the “cross bat” plan, but when they play the
    upright game of cricket with an upright bat, an upright boy is the
    likely father of an upright man.</p>
  <p id="c4_4">
    Every beginner aspires for the results of batting which are
    recorded by the scorer, conveniently ignoring the hard work of
    those who by many patient efforts have reached comparative
    perfection. But the repeated loss of his wicket
    will force him to reason out why a straight bat thwarts the
    bowler’s efforts, and why when playing a “cross bat” he has been
    unconciously reducing his defense in a ratio of four to one. To
    help this reasoning process let us demonstrate by stating that the
    batsman’s wicket without the bails presents to the bowler a
    surface of 216&nbsp;square inches. The batsman who wields a
    straight bat covers about 120&nbsp;square inches of the wicket,
    hands and gloves increasing it to about 130&nbsp;inches. The
    “cross bat” presents a defense of only 34&nbsp;square inches, or
    one-fourth that of a “straight bat,” the hands and gloves ceasing
    to the part of the defense for a “cross bat.” When the legs and
    pads of the batter are added to the defense, the bowler would seem
    to have an almost impossible task to “out” the wielder of the
    “straight bat.” Yet the “man out” seldom understands it, for he
    has not profited by the tremendous mathematical advantage of a
    “straight bat” over a “cross bat.” When this difference is
    appreciated and acted upon, the lesson of “blocking” has been
    learned and the batsman may expect scores: for he is ready to hit
    intelligently.</p>
  <p id="c4_5">
    Each ball is a lesson to the eye of the batsman who has learned to
    play a “straight bat.” The forward block as shown in illustration,
    must obtain for well pitched balls rising to the bails. The bat
    must be forwarded to the ball with left shoulder well over it, the
    bat carried at an angle of about 70°, the eye of the batsman being
    intently fixed upon it in order to insure against personal
    accidents. Such action, if prompt, forces the ball forwards
    towards the bowler. If the ball is met by the bat it strikes the
    ground at the angle of least resistance, bounds quickly into the
    field, and a run may result. Having given at length the necessity
    for the “block” as well as the scientific reasons for the play, we
    will refer the reader to illustrations Nos.&nbsp;3, 4,
    5&nbsp;and&nbsp;6, which show the “forward block,” the “half
    forward block,” the “half back block” and the “late block.” If the
    young cricketer will study the attitudes taken by Mr. George
    Bromhead when making the four characteristic blocks, he will see
    that each ball must be blocked in a manner appropriate to
    itself.</p>
  <p id="c4_6">
    Thus far only the defensive use of the bat has been considered.
    But it is a weapon as well as a shield. The tendency of beginners
    is to ignore the shield and use the weapon. One of the objects of
    these pages is to emphasize the shield, thereby perfecting the
    wield of the weapon, and multiplying the opportunities for its
    use. Let us close this portion of the chapter on batting with the
    remark that the defense of the wicket is an absolute necessity. It
    must be cultivated by beginners and practiced by experts. After it
    is thoroughly learned, like swimming, it is never forgotten. The
    batter must also resemble the swimmer in another important point,
    for the swimmer must continue swimming while in the water, and the
    batter must continue “blocking” during the rest of his career.</p>
  <p id="c4_7">
    The hit is the evidence of successful batting. An opportunity
    taken. The result hoped for by the batter. As in blocking, well
    defined principles govern the successful hit, which depends:</p>
  <p id="c4_8">
    1st—Upon its true conception by the batsman.</p>
  <p id="c4_9">
    2nd.—Upon its being properly timed.</p>
  <p id="c4_10">
    3d.—Upon the amount of energy transmitted by the batsman to the
    ball.</p>
  <p id="c4_11">
    Last but most important, the correct handling of the bat while in
    contact with the ball.</p>
  <p id="c4_12">
    Hits divide themselves into the natural, which comprise all hits
    to the “leg,” or “on” side of the wicket, and the acquired which
    include all hits to the “off” side. There are three distinct “leg”
    hits resulting from striking short pitched, well pitched, and full
    pitched, balls together with numerous sub-varieties following
    strikes of leg balls which vary from standard lengths.</p>
  <p id="c4_13">
    1st.—The stroke from a “short” or “half volley” leg ball should be
    to square leg or a little forward of that point, with the bat held
    at such an angle that the ball will strike the ground twenty or
    thirty feet from the crease. It is with regret that we observe
    that this beautiful hit is often elevated into the hands of the
    nimble fielder.</p>
  <p id="c4_14">
    2nd.—The hit resulting from the well pitched leg ball, which the
    perfect batsman strikes as it rises, to that part of the field
    just back of short leg. The appearance of the batsman while making
    this satisfying hit is illustrated in figure&nbsp;7.</p>
  <p id="c4_15">
    3d.—The full pitched leg ball can be properly dealt with in at
    least three ways by the perfect batsman. First, he can drive it to
    long field if not far to leg. Second, he can wait its arrival to a
    point between the umpire and himself, strike it on the fly to the
    rear of that long robed individual, bounding to the ropes. Third,
    while playing the waiting game an instant longer he may turn his
    person two-thirds around on his left foot, and strike the ball
    from the rear to sharp leg.</p>
  <p id="c4_16">
    All natural hits require determination and energy on the part of
    the batter if good results are expected. Modern cricket does not
    prepare itself for natural hits. On the contrary the beginner as
    well as the expert will have few balls delivered to him opportune
    for these hits.<a id="c4_16a"> </a>The modern bowler is instructed
    to force the “off” or unnatural upon the batsman. But during long
    matches even the best bowlers send up flukes, notwithstanding the
    elaborate instructions in Chapter&nbsp;3. Batsmen must therefore
    understand what is expected of them, and we do not hesitate to
    say, that the batter who can deal with good bowling can usually
    make the “loose” show upon the score. Many balls are delivered
    upon the leg side, from which only the best batsmen can score.</p>
  <p id="c4_17">
    Illustration No.&nbsp;8, shows Mr. Bromhead preparing to drive a
    nearly straight ball to the mid-wicket on.</p>
  <p id="c4_18">
    The on drives will always excite the admiration of cricketers. The
    shoulders, arms and wrists though most prominent promoters of
    these beautiful hits are assisted by every muscle of the body.
    They exemplify human energy and force. The upright bat plays the
    prominent place in this hit, and we must insist that the learner
    ignores the “cross bat” if he hopes for success.</p>

      The mind of a brilliant fielder, extends to the ends of his
      fingers and toes.</p>
  <p class="v8" id="c4_19">
    The perfect batsman plays every ball with a purpose. Illustration
    No.&nbsp;9, shows how to play a well pitched ball wending its way
    towards the leg stump. This ball he robs of all its dangerous
    tendency by forwarding his bat toward the bowler, carried at an
    angle of&nbsp;85, and almost perpendicular. This position presents
    almost a full blade to the ball, thereby defending his wicket, but
    also forces it to glance to the short legs.</p>
  <p id="c4_20">
    No.&nbsp;10, illustrates a safe and easy method of scoring from a
    ball not far enough off the wicket to risk a leg hit. Guarding the
    wicket does not enter into the batter’s calculations. But he
    forces the bat, carried at an angle of about 70&nbsp;degrees
    against the advancing ball, which rapidly finds its way towards
    sharp leg. We cannot leave this portion of our chapter until we
    emphasize the part the shoulders should play in making the natural
    hits. It is in our judgement to be regretted
    that the exigincies of the game have largely remanded the shoulder
    hitter to the back ground; but it must be acknowledged that he is
    no longer the power in the game he was prior to the period of
    special “off” bowling. But the best “trundlers” give chances to
    the shoulder hitter, and when accepted the spectator feels
    gratified that the science of cricket has been momentarily
    relaxed. If the muscular power of the batsman be not fully exerted
    upon the natural hits, we think all good cricketers will agree
    with us, that safety demands that the ball should be “let
    alone.”</p>
  <p id="c4_21">
    The modern captain instructs his bowlers to give preference to
    “off” rather than “on” balls, and places his field in accordance.
    If the bowlers do their full duty, the batter must score from
    unnatural hits only, if at all.</p>
  <p id="c4_22">
    1st.—He may receive a short pitch “off” ball, which he can drive
    to mid off, or “cover,” or he may “pull it” to “leg” by advancing
    his right leg towards point, thereby assuming the natural
    attitude, and acting as if it were a leg ball.</p>
  <p id="c4_23">
    2nd.—The over pitched “off” ball the batsman drives to long field,
    or over the bowler’s head. These “off” balls require little beyond
    a correct eye and ready hand. But the modern batsman who expects
    great success must learn to “cut,” for the large proportion of
    balls delivered are best suited for cutting.</p>
  <p id="c4_24">
    There are three distinct varieties of cuts. First, the forward
    cut. Second, the square off cut. Third, the late cut. Each play
    resulting from the relative position of the ball to the batsman
    while he is making the hit. All the cuts are made from rising
    balls distinctly to the off. When an off ball falls outside of the
    line of safety for a forward play, the batsman instantly prepares
    himself for the forward cut. This he does by elevating the bat as
    in No.&nbsp;11, at the same moment turning his face towards point,
    with his right foot somewhat advanced in the same direction, using
    his left as a pivot. This movement towards the advancing ball
    enables him to reach the spot it is soon likely to occupy. Then
    while carrying his bat at an angle of about&nbsp;70, he suddenly
    brings it down with a chopping motion until it comes in contact
    with the ball, which moves rapidly towards the boundary in a line
    between point and mid-wicket. This hit is illustrated by
    No.&nbsp;12. It is effective, as it has a tendency to spread the
    field forward.</p>

      No. 8—PREPARED TO DRIVE “ON.”</p>
  </div>
  <p class="blk10 v8">
    The Cricket Field says with truth: “You won’t win by a hitting
    game if there is no hit in you,” and adds in somewhat different
    language, “the game to carry you through is the game you play
    best.”</p>
  <p class="v8" id="c4_25">
    No.&nbsp;13, illustrates the position of the batter while making
    the square cut. This hit is made from a ball rising to the off but
    falling somewhat farther from the line of the wicket than that
    from which the forward cut is made. Were the batter to stand firm
    in his position it would be an impossibility for him to strike
    this ball, for it must be remembered that it is advancing
    obliquely towards point, and that it will have moved a
    considerable distance in that direction by the time it arrives
    opposite the batsman. But it is his business to move towards the
    ball, so that he can at least try to hit it. Mahomet must go to
    the mountain, for it is quite evident that the mountain is rapidly
    moving away from Mahomet. Having elevated his bat as in
    No.&nbsp;11, the batsman takes a long stride with his right foot
    along the line of the popping crease, then suddenly and forcibly
    bringing down his bat carried at an angle of&nbsp;70°, he “cuts”
    the ball towards point.</p>
  <p id="c4_26">
    The late or back cut is beautiful as well as the safest and most
    graceful hit in the repertoire of the batsman. But he must posess
    experience of no mean order to guide the bat to strike the ball,
    which is moving by him at a double acute angle and usually at a
    rapid rate; for instead of facing the ball and meeting it with his
    bat as in the forward and square off cut, he turns his person
    two-thirds around towards the wicket keeper using his left foot
    for a pivot. Then he takes a long stride with his right towards
    short slip, which moves him in the direction of the motion of the
    ball. While these movements are in progress the batter has
    elevated his weapon with which he strikes the ball a blow, oblique
    with its course after it has passed the line of the wicket in the
    direction of the slips. If the bat is held at an angle of
    about&nbsp;50° when it strikes, the ball will rebound from the
    turf and elude the nimble fielder. The force of the late cut is
    tremendous, as it combines the power of the shoulder hit with the
    speed of the ball. The cut is such an effective play that the
    snick has largely encroached upon it. We do not desire to condemn
    the tip or snick, for it is a frequent counter, but only desire to
    warn beginners, not to flatter themselves into the belief that
    snicks are cuts.</p>
  <p id="c4_27">
    The off bowler has come to stay, and if batters want scores they
    must cut. Batters are justly proud of their ability to cut, though
    but comparatively few make a clean hard hit of it. The tap is more
    usual, while for certain bowling safe and effective. The tap is
    from the wrist, while the cut is a combination of arm, wrist and
    shoulder.<a id="c4_27a"> </a>For clean hard cuts the Scotts of
    Belmont, Lord Hawke and George Patterson may be cited as
    exponents. The power behind their cuts is phenominal. The cutting
    of any of these is a study for experts.</p>

    CHAPTER V.<br /><br />
    <span class="xs">
      THE MANAGEMENT OF A MATCH.</span></h2>
  <p class="v2 dropcap">
    It should be constantly borne in mind that when arrangements for a
    match are being made, that the pleasure to be afforded by the game
    should be the first desideratum. A fixture having been arranged,
    let us suppose that the appointing power has named the elevens.
    The players should immediately meet and elect their captain. If
    the play of the opposing teams is even, the eleven with the best
    captain will win two out of three matches. He should be chosen
    from among the superior five. If in addition to his being captain
    he should be wicket keeper as well, chances are in favor of that
    eleven, as from that position he can silently direct the movement
    of any fielder without being observed by the batsman. The captains
    should be granted absolute obedience from fielders, for upon
    discipline depends the result. The captain should be a natural
    leader, of more than average physical endurance. He should be of
    sanguine disposition, always encouraging his men to renewed
    efforts even though disaster is imminent. He should command
    respect and obedience rather than exact it. He should be firm but
    not overbearing, earnest but not anxious, serene and not pompous
    in his bearing. Upon his judgement in posting his little army
    depends the score of his rivals. He ought to be a careful student
    of the capabilities in his own ranks as well as in those of his
    adversary.</p>
  <p id="c5_2">
    Upon the day of the proposed match the captain of the “home”
    eleven should reach the ground at least one hour before “play” is
    to be called. This timely arrival gives him leisure to assure
    himself that the wicket has been selected and rolled, places of
    absentees filled by substitutes, that lunch has been prepared, and
    that all the petty commissions including lemons and saw dust have
    been executed. The visitors having been welcomed, their captain
    interviewed, and the toss won, a consultation with his eleven
    should precede the decision of “ins” or “outs” according to
    condition of ground, weather, and players. A soft turf presents
    great advantages to the “outs,” whereas weather not foggy enough
    to prevent play may give tremendous advantages to the batsman.
    While deciding this important point the captain is entitled to the
    most intelligent assistance from his fellow players.</p>

      No. 10—SCORING FROM A WELL-PITCHED LEG BALL.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="blk10 v8">
    The good ball takes the wicket.</p>
  <p class="blk10 v4">
    There is “a length which Mr.&nbsp;Felix says brings over a man
    most indescribable emotions.”</p>
  <p class="v8" id="c5_3">
    Before calling “play” the umpires must be selected. These
    individuals are usually overlooked in unimportant games, but to
    their credit “let it be recorded” that almost without exception
    they become the impartial judge, whose absolute authority is
    acknowledged by all. To their further repute when judging their
    own batters, (for in local matches the umpires are usually chosen
    from among the “ins”), let it be said all abide by their
    decisions, right or wrong. A flagrantly incorrect decision is
    usually reversed by the united wish of the players; for all
    pleasure would be destroyed if such accidental result should
    obtain. For trophy matches the umpires should be specially chosen
    because of their thorough knowledge of cricket, as well as for
    their patient unbiased judgement. Prompt decision following close
    observation, assures implicit obedience on the part of players
    and satisfaction to all. Their first duty after consulting the two
    captains and before the first ball has been bowled is to fix the
    hours of drawing stumps, and all details of time limits. The
    captain of the “ins” having numbered and placed his batters, while
    the captain of the “outs” has marshalled his field; the umpires
    assume control. After “play” is called their power is absolute,
    and their decisions final.</p>
  <p id="c5_4">
    The work of the captain now begins. The “outs” if well disciplined
    depend largely upon the instinctive aptness of their leader. His
    assumption of the double role of captain and wicket keeper is
    notice to his men that however severe they may deem their duties,
    his require greater muscular strength, greater activity, greater
    continuance of effort and energy, greater brain power and keener
    eyesight than theirs. Every danger to which the fielders may be
    exposed is shared by the captain. When the ball is struck to any
    fielder an unobstructed view of it enables him to perform his
    duties without fear, for the watchful eye robs it of danger.<a
    id="c5_4a"> </a>Not so the wicket keeper, for the opaque batsman
    increased in size by pads, gloves, and bat, moves in uncertain
    areas between him and the bowler. Every passed ball has been
    momentarily obscured—practically lost for perhaps the
    one-twentieth of a second, to the man who is expected to receive
    it. We think it will be cheerfully acknowledged by all, that the
    man who ignoring personal danger, finds a succession of passed
    balls through a long match, anyone of which were it to strike his
    face would finish his day’s career, is a leader to be proud of.
    The ambition of the individual who can combine wicket keeper with
    captain to the satisfaction of his eleven need not be limited to
    one hemisphere. The points to be carefully watched by captains
    are:</p>
  <p id="c5_5">
    1st.—Bowler’s lengths and speeds, with a view to pointing out
    batsmen’s weak points.</p>
  <p id="c5_6">

    making a stand.</p>
  <p id="c5_7">

    changing for rest.</p>
  <p id="c5_8">
    4th.—Easing fielders whose duties require long journeys between
    overs.</p>
  <p id="c5_9">
    5th.—Anticipating and preventing overthrows, by keeping the
    attention of the fielders upon the ball.</p>
  <p id="c5_10">
    6th.—Preventing accidents from collisions, by promptly naming the
    fielder who shall try to catch an elevated ball likely to drop
    between men at even distances from its approach.</p>
  <p id="c5_11">
    7th.—Willingness to answer questions without annoyance.</p>
  <p id="c5_12">
    8th.—He should caution his men against excessive practice just
    before “play” is called, also against overloading the stomach
    before batting, a habit which has a tendency to obscure the sight,
    as well as to dull the mental and physical energy.</p>

    especially as to cap, spikes and shoes.</p>
  <p id="c5_14">

    rather better posted in every detail of the game than any one on

    CHAPTER VI.<br /><br />
    <span class="xs">
      GENERAL REMARKS.</span></h2>
  <p class="v2 dropcap">
    Some cricketers never seem to get beyond the “beginning” period,
    and it is in vain to expect anyone to delight in a thing which he
    cannot do fairly well. If these lines can convey a hint or two
    they will have accomplished a most satisfactory purpose.</p>
  <p id="c6_2">
    Let us for a moment watch a batsman plant himself before the
     wicket as though with the determination to stay there the
     remainder of the day. His mental purpose becomes his weakness,
     for no preconceived idea of what one’s opponent will do is at all
     likely to occur. The cricketer is always a creature of
     circumstances over which he usually has little or no control, but
     of which he must be ever ready to take immediate advantage. We
     used the words “plant himself” advisedly, for no other suits.
     Having planted, a vigorous growth should follow, but the
     disappointed spectator sees only a machine cricketer trying to
     force hands and wrists to do the duty, which they should but
     assist the arms and shoulders in doing. The beauty of the game is
     sacrificed to the ounce of precaution, which may have been too
     much emphasized by an over careful captain. While the game is in
     progress cricketers should be active mentally as well as
     physically, and they have only themselves to thank for the
     erroneous impression which has become prevalent that cricket is a
     sleepy game. It is waste of time to play a pure defensive game,
     and if the inveterate blocker could waste only his own time none
     would have any right to complain, but that of at least
     twenty-five others is being sacrificed at the same moment, until
     from that and many other delays a game capable of giving delight
     has become so little understood, even by American cricketers
     themselves that only foreigners can draw a crowd.</p>
  <p id="c6_3">
    The blindness of Americans to their own short comings was
    illustrated by their attitude during the recent visit of the Irish
    Team. The universal confidence in themselves, was only equalled by
    the pity expressed for their visitors who were expected to fall an
    easy prey to the representatives of Uncle Sam. Americans have set
    up a standard of their own, and many have persuaded themselves to
    believe in methods which occasionally succeed, but when the
    Englishman is at his best the American has invariably been
    defeated, excuses taking the place of good play, which are so
    generally accepted that American cricket has temporarily
    retrograded.</p>
  <p id="c6_4">
    This retrogression has been caused chiefly by ignoring the
    importance of the wicket keeper. The star known as the aggressive
    batter, or perhaps he had better be called a comet, has turned the
    heads of American cricketers. We are all sovereigns, though many
    of us cannot show that amount of cash, and why should we not all
    be star batsmen? The object is easily accomplished if the wicket
    keeper can be got rid of. The attempt has not only been made, but
    has been actually imposed upon the American public as cricket; for
    though wearing the armor of that great office, he is located ten
    to fifteen feet behind the batsman, thereby becoming a fielder;
    with the tremendious consequence that first-class wicket keeping
    is rarely seen in America. But we have many aggressive batters,
    who settle down into first-rate bats when in the presence of a
    standard wicket keeper. We say most of them, advisedly, for a star
    will shine, wicket keeper, or no wicket keeper. The true
    aggressive batsman is a combination of cause and effect which no
    amount of ambition can even hope to imitate. Brain, guiding
    muscle, with discipline resulting from long and patient training.
    He can take almost any liberty with the bowler, he can play inside
    or outside his crease, for the dangerous ball never reaches the
    wicket keeper. But it must be remembered that he is a star. He is
    the perfect batsman referred to on several occasions, who hits
    every ball which does not threaten his wicket, and many that do.
    His powerful physique, eagle eye, and energetic mind have given
    him a place beyond his companions. That instinctive knowledge of
    the presence of a man immediately behind him who will down his
    wicket with a smile of satisfaction, must be forever present in
    the mind of the batter. American cricketers may ignore him, but
    when America meets her English competitor and hopes for the like
    convenient ignorance, she is sure to have her pride injured.</p>
  <p id="c6_5">
    A match is never lost ’till it is won, and the unexpected may at
    any time happen, which is a great charm in the game. The
    disappointment which follows the fall of wicket after wicket,
    simply because the reliable bat has had the misfortune to be
    bowled, is not easily described, but we have experienced the
    keenest anguish when the catastrophy has happened to our side;
    while excessive buoyancy seems to have taken posession of and
    intoxicated our opponents. The American audience is so completely
    bent upon victory that good cricket is momentarily lost sight of.
    If cricketers will remember that superior play ought to be the
    object, and will forget the result, these exhibitions of inferior
    cricket will be fewer. The courage and nerve which are sure to

    follow careful training and good discipline, can and will prepare
    each batter to depend upon himself, rather than follow a bad
    example.</p>
  <p id="c6_6">
    Fielding is too much neglected for the more pleasant occupation of
    batting. The net is a useful invention, a tremendous time saver,
    thoroughly in accord with other economic devices of the age, but
    it has not improved fielding. Fielders should practice their art
    when the game is not in progress if they expect success while the
    eyes of spectators are concentrated upon a hard hit ball. The
    silence which follows faulty fielding is quite as emphatic as the
    cry of “muff” or “butter-fingers.” The fielder is always on
    exhibition in the proportion of eleven to one batter, so that his
    opportunities for the display of either good or bad play are many.
    If cricketers will bring to their game the excellent qualities
    displayed upon the diamond, theirs will soon be recognized as the
    popular game. Greater interest is felt in fine fielding than in
    brilliant batting by the spectator, though from a cricketers
    standpoint a finished batsman will always be the favorite. There
    seems no excuse for poor fielding unless to permit the second-rate
    bat to score double figures. It is with much regret that we feel
    the necessity of dwelling upon this subject at length, but these
    hints would be otherwise incomplete. Before closing we desire to
    thank Mr.&nbsp;S. V.&nbsp;Merrick, Secretary of the Germantown
    Cricket Club, for his kind assistance while these photographs were
    being taken at Manheim.<a id="c6_6a"> </a>The atitudes of
    Mr.&nbsp;George Bromhead, their professional cricketer, which
    illustrates this essay, were made instanteneously, and wherever
    possible while bat and ball were in motion. It may therefore be
    assumed that for the purpose of either “beginner” or “expert”
    these positions are as close to life as it is possible to secure
    them.</p>

    with a bail two feet long succeeded the single stick in the year
    1700. The years 1781, 1814, and 1817 are all memorable for changes
    in the wicket, which since the latter year has remained the same.
    Single wicket cricket only was played until 1710, when the Scotch
    developed double wicket under the name of “cat and dog.” The game
    has been and is a progressive one, each generation revealing
    improvements. The diagram shows the various sizes and shapes of
    the wicket:</p>

    CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />
    <span class="xs">
      LAWS OF CRICKET.—AS REVISED BY THE MARLEYBONE CRICKET CLUB,
      MAY,&nbsp;1890.</span></h2>
  <p class="v2">
    1. A match is played between two sides of eleven players each,
    unless otherwise agreed to; each side has two innings, taken
    alternately, except in the case provided for in Law&nbsp;53. The
    choice of innings shall be decided by tossing.</p>
  <p id="c8_2">
    2. The score shall be reckoned by runs. A run is scored—1st, so
    often as the batsmen after a hit, or at any time while the ball is
    in play, shall have crossed, and made good their ground from end
    to end. 2d, for penalties under Laws&nbsp;16, 34, 41, and
    allowances under&nbsp;44. Any run or runs so scored shall be duly
    recorded by scorers appointed for the purpose. The side which
    scores the greatest number of runs wins the match. No match is won
    unless played out or given up, except in the case provided for in
    Law&nbsp;45.</p>
  <p id="c8_3">
    3. Before the commencement of the match two umpires shall be
    appointed, one for each end.</p>
  <p id="c8_4">
    4. The ball shall weigh not less than 5½&nbsp;oz., nor more than
    5¾&nbsp;oz. It shall measure not less than 9&nbsp;in. nor more
    than 9¼&nbsp;in. in circumference. At the beginning of each
    innings either side may demand a new ball.</p>
  <p id="c8_5">
    5. The bat shall not exceed 4¼&nbsp;in. in the widest part; it
    shall not be more than 38&nbsp;in. in length.</p>
  <p id="c8_6">
    6. The wickets shall be pitched opposite and parallel to each
    other, at a distance of 22&nbsp;yards. Each wicket shall be
    8&nbsp;in. in width and consist of three stumps, with two bails
    upon the top. The stumps shall be of equal and sufficient size to
    prevent the ball from passing through, and 27&nbsp;in. out of the
    ground. The bails shall be each 4&nbsp;in. in length and when in
    position, on the top of the stumps, shall not project more than
    ½&nbsp;in. above them. The wickets shall not be changed during a
    match, unless the ground between them become unfit for play, and
    then only by consent of both sides.</p>
  <p id="c8_7">
    7. The bowling crease shall be in a line with the stumps
    6&nbsp;ft. 8&nbsp;in. in length; the stumps in the center, with a
    return crease at each end, at right angles behind the wicket.</p>
  <p id="c8_8">
    8. The popping crease shall be marked 4&nbsp;ft. from the wicket,
    parallel to it, and be deemed unlimited in length.</p>
  <p id="c8_9">
    9. The ground shall not be rolled, watered, covered, mown or
    beaten during a match, except before the commencement of each
    innings and of each day’s play, when, unless the inside object,
    the ground shall be swept and rolled for not more than ten
    minutes. This shall not prevent the batsman from beating the
    ground with his bat, nor the batsmen nor bowler from using sawdust
    in order to obtain a proper foothold.</p>
  <p id="c8_10">
    10. The ball must be bowled; if thrown or jerked, the umpire shall
    call “No ball.”</p>
  <p id="c8_11">
    11. The bowler shall deliver the ball with one foot on the ground
    behind the bowling crease, and within the return crease, otherwise
    the umpire shall call “No ball.”</p>
  <p id="c8_12">
    12. If the bowler shall bowl the ball so high over or so wide of
    the wicket that in the opinion of the umpire it is not within
    reach of the striker, the umpire shall call “Wide ball.”</p>
  <p id="c8_13">
    13. The ball shall be bowled in overs of five balls from each
    wicket alternately. When five balls have been bowled and the ball
    is finally settled in the bowler’s or wicket-keeper’s hands, the
    umpire shall call “Over.” Neither a “no ball” nor a “wide ball”
    shall be reckoned as one of the “over.”</p>
  <p id="c8_14">
    14. The bowler shall be allowed to change ends as often as he
    pleases, provided only that he does not bowl two overs
    consecutively in one innings.</p>
  <p id="c8_15">
    15. The bowler may require the batsman at the wicket from which he
    is bowling to stand on that side of it which he may direct.</p>
  <p id="c8_16">
    16. The striker may hit a “no-ball,” and whatever runs result
    shall be added to his score; but he shall not be out from a “no
    ball,” unless he be run out, or break Laws&nbsp;26, 27,
    29,&nbsp;30. All runs made from a “no-ball,” otherwise than from
    the bat, shall be scored “no-balls,” and if no run be made one run
    shall be added to that score. From a “wide ball” as many runs as
    are run shall be added to the score as “wide balls,” and if no run
    be otherwise obtained one run shall be so added.</p>
  <p id="c8_17">
    17. If the ball, not having been called “wide” or “no-ball,” pass
    the striker, without touching his bat or person, and any runs be
    obtained, the umpire shall call “Bye;” but if the ball touch any
    part of the striker’s person (hand excepted) and any run be
    obtained, the umpire shall call “Leg-bye,” such runs to be scored
    “byes” and “leg-byes” respectively.</p>
  <p id="c8_18">
    18. At the beginning of the match, and of each innings, the umpire
    at the bowler’s wicket shall call “Play;” from that time no trial
    ball shall be allowed to any bowler on the ground between the
    wickets, and when one of the batsman is out the use of the bat
    shall not be allowed to any person until the next batsman shall
    come in.</p>
  <p id="c8_19">
    19. A batsman shall be held to be “out of his ground” unless his
    bat in hand or some part of his person be grounded within the line
    of the popping crease.</p>
  <p id="c8_20">
    20. The wicket shall be held to be “down” when either of the bails
    is struck off, or, if both bails be off, when a stump is struck
    out of the ground.</p>
  <p id="c8_21">
    The striker is out:</p>
  <p id="c8_22">
    21. If the wicket be bowled down, even if the ball first touch the
    striker’s bat or person:—“Bowled.”</p>
  <p id="c8_23">
    22. Or, if the ball, from a stroke of the bat or hand, but not the
    wrist, be held before it touch the ground, although it be hugged
    to the body of the catcher:—“Caught.”</p>
  <p id="c8_24">
    23. Or, if in playing at the ball, provided it be not touched by
    the bat or hand, the striker be out of his ground, and the wicket
    be put down by the wicket-keeper with the ball or with the hand or
    arm, with ball in hand:—“Stumped.”</p>
  <p id="c8_25">
    24. Or, if with any part of his person he stop the ball, which in
    the opinion of the umpire at the bowler’s wicket shall have been
    pitched in a straight line from it to the strikers wicket and
    would have hit it:—“Leg before wicket.”</p>
  <p id="c8_26">
    25. Or, if in playing at the ball he hit down his wicket with his
    bat or any part of his person or dress:—“Hit wicket.”</p>
  <p id="c8_27">
    26. Or, if under pretense of running, or otherwise, either of the
    batsmen willfully prevent a ball from being caught:—“Obstructing
    the field.”</p>
  <p id="c8_28">
    27. Or, if the ball be struck, or be stopped by any part of his
    person, and he willfully strike it again, except it be done for
    the purpose of guarding his wicket, which he may do with his bat,
    or any part of his person, except his hands:—“Hit the ball
    twice.”</p>
  <p id="c8_29">
    Either batsman is out:</p>
  <p id="c8_30">
    28. If in running, or at any other time, while the ball is in play
    he be out of his ground, and his wicket be struck down by the ball
    after touching any fieldsman, or by the hand or arm, with ball in
    hand, or any fieldsman:—“Run out.”</p>
  <p id="c8_31">
    29. Or, if he touch with his hands or take up the ball while in
    play, unless at the request of the opposite side:—“Handled the
    ball.”</p>
  <p id="c8_32">
    30. Or if he willfully obstruct any fieldsman:—“Obstructing the
    field.”</p>
  <p id="c8_33">
    31. If the batsmen have crossed each other, he that runs for the
    wicket which is put down is out; if they have not crossed, he that
    has left the wicket which is put down is out.</p>
  <p id="c8_34">
    32. The striker being caught no run shall be scored. A batsman
    being run out, that run which was being attempted shall not be
    scored.</p>
  <p id="c8_35">
    33. A batsman being out from any cause, the ball shall be
    “dead.”</p>
  <p id="c8_36">
    34. If a ball in play cannot be found or recovered, any fieldsman
    may call “Lost Ball,” when the ball shall be “dead:” six runs
    shall be added to the score, but if more than six runs have been
    run before “lost ball” has been called, as many runs as have been
    run shall be scored.</p>
  <p id="c8_37">
    35. After the ball shall have been finally settled in the
    wicket-keeper’s or bowler’s hand it shall be “dead;” but when the
    bowler is about to deliver the ball, if the batsman at his wicket
    be out of his ground before actual delivery, the said bowler may
    run him out; but if the bowler throw at that wicket and any run
    result it shall be scored “no ball.”</p>
  <p id="c8_38">
    36. A batsman shall not retire from his wicket and return to it to
    complete his innings after another has been in without the consent
    of the opposite side.</p>
  <p id="c8_39">
    37. A substitute shall be allowed to field or run between wickets
    for any player who may during the match be incapacitated from
    illness or injury, but for no other reason, except with the
    consent of the opposite side.</p>
  <p id="c8_40">
    38. In all cases where a substitute shall be allowed, the consent
    of the opposite side shall be obtained as to the person to act as
    substitute and the place in the field which he shall take.</p>
  <p id="c8_41">
    39. In case any substitute shall be allowed to run between
    wickets, the striker may be run out if either he or his substitute
    be out of his ground. If the striker be out of his ground while
    the ball is in play, that wicket which he has left may be put down
    and the striker given out, although the other batsman may have
    made good the ground at that end, and the striker and his
    substitute at the other end.</p>
  <p id="c8_42">
    40. A batsman is liable to be out for any infringement of the laws
    by his substitute.</p>
  <p id="c8_43">
    41. The fieldsman may stop the ball with any part of his person,
    but if he willfully stop it otherwise the ball shall be “dead,”
    and five runs added to the score. Whatever runs may have been made
    five only shall be added.</p>
  <p id="c8_44">
    42. The wicket-keeper shall stand behind the wicket. If he shall
    take the ball for the purpose of stumping before it has passed the
    wicket, or if he shall incommode the striker by any noise, or
    motion, or if any part of his person be over or before the wicket,
    the striker shall not be out, excepting under Laws&nbsp;26, 27,
    28, 29&nbsp;and&nbsp;30.</p>
  <p id="c8_45">
    43. The umpires are the sole judges of fair or unfair play, of the
    fitness of the ground, the weather, and the light for play; all
    disputes shall be determined by them, and if they disagree the
    actual state of things shall continue.</p>
  <p id="c8_46">
    44. They shall pitch ther wickets, arrange boundaries where
    necessary, and the allowances to be made for them, and change ends
    after each side has had one innings.</p>
  <p id="c8_47">
    45. They shall allow two minutes for each striker to come in and
    ten minutes between each innings. When they shall call “Play,” the
    side refusing to play shall lose the match.</p>
  <p id="c8_48">
    46. They shall not order a batsman out unless appealed to by the
    other side.</p>
  <p id="c8_49">
    47. The umpire at the bowler’s wicket shall be appealed to before
    the other umpire in all cases except in those of stumping, hit the
    wicket, run out at the striker’s wicket, or arising under
    Law&nbsp;42, but in any case in which an umpire is unable to give
    a decision he shall appeal to the other umpire, whose decision
    shall be final.</p>
  <p id="c8_50">
    48 A. If the umpire at the bowler’s end be not satisfied of the
    absolute fairness of the delivery of any ball, he shall call “No
    ball.”</p>
  <p id="c8_51">
    48 B. The umpire shall take especial care to call “No ball”
    instantly upon delivery, “Wide ball” as soon as it shall have
    passed the striker.</p>
  <p id="c8_52">
    49. If either batsman run a short run, the umpire shall call “One
    short,” and the run shall not be scored.</p>
  <p id="c8_53">
    50. After the umpire has called “Over” the ball is “dead” but an
    appeal may be made as to whether either batsman is out, such
    appeal, however, shall not be made after the delivery of the next
    ball, nor after any cessation of play.</p>
  <p id="c8_54">
    51. No umpire shall be allowed to bet.</p>
  <p id="c8_55">
    52. No umpire shall be changed during a match unless with the
